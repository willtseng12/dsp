[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

```python
import random
import thinkstats2
import thinkplot

#The numbers generated by random.random are supposed to be uniform 
#between 0 and 1; that is, every value in the range should have 
#the same probability.

#Generate 1000 numbers from random.random and plot their PMF and CDF. 
#Is the distribution uniform?

randList = []
for i in range(1000):
    randList.append(random.random())
    
cdf = thinkstats2.Cdf(randList)
pmf = thinkstats2.Pmf(randList)



thinkplot.Cdf(cdf)
thinkplot.Show(xlabel='observations', ylabel='CDF')
thinkplot.Pmf(pmf)
thinkplot.Show(xlabel='observations', ylabel='PMF')

# From the PMF and CDF we see that the random list of numbers generated
# are indeed uniformly distributed. The CDF is a straight diagonal line
# (roughly y = x) and the PMF is a flat line suggesting all values 
# between 0 and 1 have equal robability of being chosen.
```
